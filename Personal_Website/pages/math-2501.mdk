The notes below were taken **live in-class** during Prof. Hughes' MATH 2501 lectures at Vanderbilt University. They are provided here exclusively as a **historical record** of what topics were covered during each day of class. For readers who aim to learn this material for the first time, they are **incomplete** in several crucial ways:

* Gaps in the logical flow of ideas due to missed classes.
* Omitted discussions, proofs, and examples which I considered obvious.
* Missing sections which were written down on paper and never typeset.

Time permitting, I plan to release an **expanded and revised** version of these notes in the future to address these deficiencies.
