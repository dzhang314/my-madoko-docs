Here's what I'm working on.

I'm currently working with [Alex Aiken](http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/) to design and implement a [sparse solver library](https://github.com/dzhang314/LegionSolvers) for the [Legion parallel programming system](https://legion.stanford.edu/).

In the spring of 2020, I worked with the [LCLS Advanced Methods Group](https://lcls.slac.stanford.edu/) at [SLAC](https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/) to develop an iterative inversion algorithm for the [non-uniform fast Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_discrete_Fourier_transform), targeting applications in [single-molecule diffraction imaging](https://dx.doi.org/10.1073%2Fpnas.1513738112) as part of the [Exascale Computing Project](https://lcls.slac.stanford.edu/exafel).
